# Todo List

A simple and user-friendly Todo List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them, with all data stored in `localStorage` to persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: Enter a task in the input field and press `Enter` or submit the form to add the todo item to the list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Left-click on any todo item to mark it as completed (strikethrough) or uncompleted.
- **Delete Todo**: Right-click on any todo item to delete it from the list.
- **Data Persistence**: All todos are saved in `localStorage`, so they will remain even after a page reload.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter your task in the input field and press `Enter` to add it to the list.
4. Click on a task to mark it as completed. Right-click on a task to delete it.
